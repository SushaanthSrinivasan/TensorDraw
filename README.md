# Generate Neural Net Diagrams directly from your code

TensorDraw is a python library that allows you to generate neural network diagrams directly from your code. \
By passing your model file into the library, it automatically generates the LaTeX code for drawing neural networks and renders it as a PDF.

Built on top of PlotNeuralNet.
